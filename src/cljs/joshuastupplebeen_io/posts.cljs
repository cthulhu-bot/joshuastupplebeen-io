  "Finally upgraded this site to something cool, slick and infinitely more

  "Currently working on a temporal library modeled off of immutablejs and I needed a
place to be able to log about the process as a way of getting thoughts down onto paper. 
Right now I'm working on a way to both preserve internal state of the objects prior 
values as well as the api to access those prior values. Probably going with 'inspect' as
the viewing api since we're only working on partial persistence for now.")
